          "description": "<p>Data-driven Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising approach to building predictive models from medical data, which is collected in huge volumes by modern healthcare systems. Unfortunately, existing medical data is not fully utilized by the industry since there are data silos and privacy concerns with accessibility to the data. Health data are highly sensitive, subject to regulation and cannot be used for research without appropriate patient consent and ethical approval. In addition, these datasets have a significant business value and companies are not willing to share with researchers for the fear of losing a considerable amount of revenue. The main focus of this project is to explore a new technology called Federated Machine Learning (FML), which is a learning method that seeks to address the problem of data sharing, data governance and privacy by training algorithms collaboratively without exchanging the underlying datasets.</p><p>FML is a transformative technology that can be a game changer for the healthcare industry with positive impacts for patient health outcomes. The strength of FML is that sensitive training data does not need to be moved beyond the firewalls of the institutions in which they reside. Instead, ML models are created locally at each participating institution (data agent) and only model characteristics are exchanged. Once training has been completed, the trained consensus model benefits from the knowledge accumulated across all data agents. We believe that FML holds significant potential for enabling precision medicine at large scale. The aim of this project is to construct an FML platform, perform and execute FML with different data agents and provide context and detail for the community regarding the benefits, limitations and impact of FML in the context of digital health. We are exploring three different types of FML (horizontal, vertical, and transfer) as well as two structures of execution: a centralized aggregator and peer to peer network.</p>",

Searchable encryption is a cryptographic primitive that allows a user to outsource an encrypted collection of data to a third party, but still retain the ability to execute searches over that data in such a way that the server doesn’t learn the user’s search query.</p><p>This project resulted in an implementation of a dynamic webpage that allowed users to store encrypted images to be stored on the server while still allowing the user to search over the images without revealing what they are looking for. Beyond simple searching, the searchable encryption primitive was applied to the resizing of images with some success.</p>",
